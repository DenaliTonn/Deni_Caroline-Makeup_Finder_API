Description: This app uses React and CSS to pull in data from an API that contains information on different makeup products and display them based on two filters entered by the user. The Makeup Finder app allows the user to enter a brand of makeup and a product type, and will be shown a max of 10 products that fit said criteria, showing the products name, price, and image. The design of the app, meaning the colors, layout, fonts, font sizes, text shadows, padding, margins, and more were all done using CSS. The actual retrieval of the input fields, displaying of filters being used, displaying of other text, as well as the listing of the data for the filtered products (including product name, price, and image) are all handled using React.
